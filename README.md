# TamagotchiAPI

This is the API that supports the tamagotchi-front-end. I built this during my tenure at Suncoast Developers Guild.

This was my first venture into controllers. It was fun to experiment with query parameters; I was able to make things a little more interesting. Take a trip to my graveyard page on the tamagotchi-front-end to find out!
